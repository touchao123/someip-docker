## Contents

## What is this?

This project is an exhaustive README template that you can customize to your needs.
You can either add sections you like or remove sections you don't like. But you have
every time an example in front of you, from which you can derive from.

## Why should I use this?

There are many README templates out there so why this one? The two main reasons for this are
that they contain often too little content or they are not easy to read or navigate through.
